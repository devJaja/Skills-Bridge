# 🌉 SkillBridge

Bringing **skilled professionals onchain** with **Doma Protocol** — where domains become **on-chain landing pages**, **messaging hubs**, and **DeFi-enabled assets**.

---

## 🎯 Problem
Skilled professionals (doctors, carpenters, teachers, developers, etc.) lack **trusted digital identities** and **global visibility**. Current job platforms are centralized, charge high fees, and provide little ownership or portability of reputation.

---

## 🚀 Solution
SkillBridge transforms every professional into a **domain-backed on-chain identity** using the **Doma Protocol**:

- Each worker mints or links a **tokenized domain** (e.g., `doctor.website.io`, `carpenter.website.io`).
- Domains act as **decentralized landing pages** hosted on IPFS, displaying verified skills and certifications.
- **Messaging interfaces** (XMTP / Push Protocol) allow direct wallet-to-wallet communication.
- Domains, as RWAs, can be **fractionalized, traded, or staked in DeFi protocols** for credit-building and access to financing.

---

## ⚡ Features
- **On-Chain Landing Pages**  
  Tokenized domains mapped to IPFS-hosted profiles via Doma Protocol.  

- **Messaging Interfaces**  
  Wallet-native communication between clients and professionals.  

- **Domains as Collateral**  
  Domains as RWAs usable in DeFi: staking, lending, fractionalization.  

- **Reputation & Verification**  
  Link NFT credentials and past work records to domain identity.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React + TailwindCSS (deployed on IPFS via Pinata/Fleek)  
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (ERC-721/1155 for credentials, Doma integration)  
- **Messaging:** XMTP or Push Protocol  
- **Doma Protocol SDK:** Tokenize and manage domains  
- **DeFi Hooks:** Integrations with Aave/Compound or custom lending logic  

---

## 🎯 Hackathon Track
**Track 5: Landing Pages & Messaging Interfaces**  
- Each domain = a worker’s **professional storefront**  
- Integrated **messaging** for direct hiring  
- DeFi integrations unlock new **financial opportunities**  

---

## 📌 Deliverables
1. **Public GitHub Repo** – smart contracts + frontend integration  
2. **Demo Video** – show a carpenter minting a domain and getting messaged by a client  
3. **Documentation** – explanation of how SkillBridge uses Doma Protocol
